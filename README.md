# dread-hunger-rolepicker

Role picker for the game Dread Hunger.

Short demo:

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bladesheng/dread-hunger-rolepicker/main/demo.gif)

Select 8 players and press the shuffle button. Players will be assigned random roles.

Output is shown on the page and a neatly formated text is also copied to clipboard, so you can immediately paste it to Discord.

Players are saved to localstorage, so you don't have to keep adding their names every time, even when you close the tab.

Some players are already loaded and you can add more / delete them as you wish.
